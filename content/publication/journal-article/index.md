abstract: Applying artificial intelligence technology in 3D modeling can simplify the operation of 3D modeling and generate many 3D models in a rapid way. If combining storyboard with 3D modeling, artists can participate in Pre-Visualization, also known as PreViz, production. In recent years, sketch⁃based 3D modeling has been gradually applied to the rapid generation of digital assets. The authors propose a PreViz production process based on sketch⁃based modeling and game engine, and the sketch⁃based 3D modeling method is used to produce the digital assets. The geometric modeling experiment, human and animal modeling experiments, and user experience experiments were designed to analyse the outcomes. This re⁃ search invited 50 participants to conduct a semi⁃structured interview study for evaluating the process. The results showed that the process met the requirements of users' habits, and PreViz satisfied its co⁃creators. This research evaluates the generation capability of sketch⁃based modeling for PreViz production, and explores the potential of artificial intelligence generated content, which is usually named as AIGC, in digital film production.
