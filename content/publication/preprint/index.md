abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between cybersickness and postural behavior, by analyzing the surface electromyography (sEMG) signals and hand movement videos. We conducted a user study to build the sEMG-video Cybersickness Benchmark Dataset (sEMG-CBD) and employed statistical analysis to summarize the regular pattern of participantsâ€™ dizziness status under VR experiences. The results indicate that the fluctuations of cybersickness correlate positively with the extent of forearm sEMG signals and hand movements.
