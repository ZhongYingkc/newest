Cinematic Virtual Reality (CVR) is an increasingly popular digital art production technology that could enhance the sense
of presence when a viewer explores immersive environments. There are three important viewing-experience-related aspects, attention, sustainability, and guidance, which can be affected by the cinematography principles. Attention indicates whether the viewer is focusing on the storytelling-related region or not. Sustainability refers to viewers’ ability to continuously watch the CVR content, and guidance affects the understanding of the narrative. In this paper, we conducted within-subject repeated-measures experiments on 22 participants in an HMD-based immersive environment, to explore the correlation between viewing experience and comprehensive factors. According to experimental results, we suggest an attention-comfort-understanding analysis paradigm for directing the CVR shot, which could help creators effectively attract viewers’ attention, minimize the cybersickness, and deepen their understanding of narratives.
