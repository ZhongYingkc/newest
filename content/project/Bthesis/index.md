Applying artificial intelligence technology in 3D modeling can simplify the operation of 3D modeling and generate many 
3D models in a rapid way. If combining storyboard with 3D modeling, artists can participate in Pre-Visualization, also known as 
PreViz, production. In recent years, sketch⁃based 3D modeling has been gradually applied to the rapid generation of digital assets. 
The authors propose a PreViz production process based on sketch⁃based modeling and game engine, and the sketch⁃based 3D 
modeling method is used to produce the digital assets. The geometric modeling experiment, human and animal modeling 
experiments, and user experience experiments were designed to analyse the outcomes. This re⁃ search invited 50 participants to 
conduct a semi⁃structured interview study for evaluating the process. The results showed that the process met the requirements of 
users' habits, and PreViz satisfied its co⁃creators. This research evaluates the generation capability of sketch⁃based modeling for 
PreViz production, and explores the potential of artificial intelligence generated content, which is usually named as AIGC, in digital 
film production.

After graduation, the thesis was modified and accepted by 2022 China VR Conference (oral presentation), and published in Advanced Motion Picture Technology (in Chinese).
