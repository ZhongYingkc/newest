Panoramic video offers an immersive viewing experience in which viewers can actively explore 360-degree motion pictures and engage with the narrative. Studying user visual attention behavior could help us to have a better understanding of video processing, semantic learning, and coding in 360-degree videos. In this paper, we developed two attention visualization toolkits, visual saliency map and semantic attention annotation, for collecting ROI data. The practice-based analytical methodology is employed to discuss user behavior while viewing panoramic shorts. We gathered viewing behavior data from 23 participants and visualized attention saliency to analyze the viewersâ€™ visual attention behavior and narrative cognition process. According to the collected data, we summarize attention distribution regulations and derive practical insights into the aspects of learning decision-making for panorama production.

We used Insta Titan to film our panoramic content.
